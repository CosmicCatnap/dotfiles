# dotfiles
My dotfiles for anybody for any reason, go nuts. 

NOTE: I use oh-my-zsh (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and i3pystatus(https://github.com/enkore/i3pystatus) which are reqiured for these configurations to work correctly. All other packages and files can be installed with `bootstrap.sh` 
Keep in mind `bootstrap.sh` only works for `Arch Linux` and I have no plans to extend that support to other distributions but a quick look at the script should tell you what packages are used.
